# Sell Your Books
This is an application made in react-native that is a marketplace for students to buy and sell their used textbooks. It works similar to how KSL or Craigslist does in the sense that a user has an account where they can post their books from and they can get in contact with another user by contacting them via email. Users can search for textbooks using the books title, author or course id associated with the class the book is for.
